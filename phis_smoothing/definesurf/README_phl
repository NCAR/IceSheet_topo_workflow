Workflow for smoothing PHIS for the finite-volume dynamical core
================================================================

1. go to the input/make_raw_phis_from_usgs/ directory

2. the NCL script (make-10min-raw-phis.ncl) will take the raw 30 sec (~1km) raw USGS data in netCDF
   format (usgs-rawdata.nc) and average it to a 10min grid (grid descriptor is 10min-usgs-fv.nc).

       run the ncl script: ncl < make-10min-raw-phis.ncl

   It should generate a file named: 10min-phis-raw.nc

3. go back to the definesurf directory and compile the smoothing code with make

4. run the script: ./run.sh which should generate the smoothed PHIS file: smooth-phis.nc
